The blog revolves around the theme of healthy smoothie bowl recipes and features essential elements such as a homepage, an About page, a list of blog posts, individual pages for each blog post, and a contact page. To bring this concept to life, I utilized Figma to design a prototype. The development process involved HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while WordPress served as the API source for retrieving smoothie recipes and images.",
